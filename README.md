# Multithreaded Chat Application â€“ Task Summary  

For this task, I used **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my development environment to write, compile, and execute the Java program. VS Code provides a clean interface and useful extensions, such as the **Java Extension Pack**, which helps with writing, debugging, and running Java code efficiently.  

The program focuses on building a **multithreaded client-server chat application** using **Java Sockets** and **Multithreading**. It enables multiple clients to connect to a central server and communicate in real-time. The key features and operations implemented in the program include:  

- Establishing a **server** that listens for client connections.  
- Implementing **multithreading** to handle multiple clients simultaneously.  
- Allowing clients to **send and receive messages** in real time.  
- Broadcasting messages so that all connected clients receive updates.  
- Providing a **simple text-based chat interface** for communication.  

## Applicability of the Code  
This program can be used in various real-world scenarios, such as:  

- **Online Chat Systems:** Used in messaging applications for real-time text communication.  
- **Customer Support Chatbots:** Assisting in automated or live customer support services.  
- **Collaborative Workspaces:** Enabling multiple users to communicate over a shared network.  
- **Gaming Applications:** Implementing chat features in multiplayer games.  

## What I Learned  
Through this task, I gained practical experience in:  

- **Networking in Java** using **Socket** and **ServerSocket** classes.  
- **Multithreading concepts** to handle multiple clients concurrently.  
- **Input/Output streams** for reading and writing data between server and clients.  
- **Exception handling** to manage network and I/O-related errors.  
- **Real-time message broadcasting** in a client-server model.  

This task helped me understand how **networking and multithreading** work together in Java and how real-time communication applications can be developed efficiently.
